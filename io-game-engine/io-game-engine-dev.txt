The IO Game Engine



Why Rust?

I choose the rust languange as a new developer because of its performance, focus on correctness, and lack of footguns. 
Rust is more than a programming language, and I don't know if I would start this project with rust if the cargo package manager didn't exist.


Overall Plan

The IO Game Engine is actually being made initially with the Bevy game framework. New features will initially be developed with it's ecosyystem of 
plugins, but eventually external dependencies will be replaced. In theory, anything developed for the engine should work for Bevy because of 
how the framweork is designed, at least until Bevy itself is phaised out.

I choose Bevy because of it's Entity Component System. the dev team continously improves the ergonomics of the system, and it's wonderful to program with.
